# Data Squirrel AI Project: Big Shop Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project leverages Data Squirrel AI to analyze sales data from a big shop, deriving actionable insights and visualizations. The analysis focuses on customer segmentation, sales performance, and regional analysis.

## Dataset
### Big Shop Sales Data (`Big_Shop_Sales (2).xlsx`)
This dataset contains detailed sales information from various transactions, including:
- **Transaction ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Product ID**: Identifier for each product sold.
- **Quantity Sold**: Number of units sold per transaction.
- **Sales Amount**: Total sales amount for each transaction.
- **Date of Sale**: Date when the transaction occurred.
- **Customer Details**: Information about the customers who made the purchases, including region and customer type.


## Problem Statement

### Background
In the competitive retail industry, understanding sales performance and customer behavior is crucial for making informed business decisions. The provided sales data from a big shop includes detailed transaction records, product information, and customer details. Analyzing this data can reveal valuable insights that help optimize sales strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve overall business performance.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to leverage Data Squirrel AI to analyze the `Big_Shop_Sales (2).xlsx` dataset. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and trends in the sales data, segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, and identify key factors influencing sales performance. The insights derived from this analysis will be used to create actionable recommendations and visualizations to support strategic decision-making.

### Key Questions
1. **Sales Trends**: What are the overall sales trends over time? Are there any seasonal patterns or significant fluctuations?
2. **Regional Performance**: How do sales vary across different regions? Which regions are performing best or worst?
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Can we segment customers based on their purchasing behavior? What are the characteristics of each segment?
4. **Product Performance**: Which products are the top performers in terms of sales volume and revenue? Are there any underperforming products?
5. **Influencing Factors**: What factors (e.g., time of year, customer type, region) have the most significant impact on sales?

### Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Use Data Squirrel AI to automatically clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct EDA to understand the structure of the data, identify patterns, and uncover initial insights.
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Apply clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics.
4. **Sales Analysis**: Analyze sales trends over time, by region, and by product to identify key insights.
5. **Visualization**: Create visualizations using Data Squirrel AI and Power BI to effectively communicate the findings and support decision-making.

### Expected Outcomes
- A set of clean, well-structured data ready for analysis.
- Detailed insights into sales trends, regional performance, and customer segments.
- Visualizations that highlight key findings and support strategic recommendations.
- Actionable insights to help the big shop optimize its sales strategies and improve overall business performance.

### Deliverables
- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
- Exploratory data analysis report.
- Customer segmentation analysis and report.
- Sales analysis report with visualizations.
- Final presentation summarizing key findings and recommendations.
